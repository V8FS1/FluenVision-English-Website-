      <p>
        Look at these examples to see how zero, first and second conditionals
        are used.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If you freeze water, it becomes solid.</li>
          <li>If it rains tomorrow, I'll take the car.</li>
          <li>If I lived closer to the cinema, I would go more often.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Grammar explanation</h2>
      <p>
        Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause
        tells you the condition (If you study hard) and the main clause tells
        you the result (you will pass your exams). The order of the clauses
        does not change the meaning.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If you study hard, you will pass your exams.</li>
          <li>You will pass your exams if you study hard.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Conditional sentences are often divided into different types.</p>

      <h3>Zero conditional</h3>

      <p>
        We use the zero conditional to talk about things that are generally
        true, especially for laws and rules.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If I drink too much coffee, I can't sleep at night.</li>
          <li>Ice melts if you heat it.</li>
          <li>When the sun goes down, it gets dark.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The structure is: if/when + present simple >> present simple.</p>

      <h3>First conditional</h3>

      <p>
        We use the first conditional when we talk about future situations we
        believe are real or possible.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the beach.</li>
          <li>Arsenal will be top of the league if they win.</li>
          <li>When I finish work, I'll call you.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually: if/when +
        present simple >> will + infinitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also common to use this structure with unless, as long as, as
        soon as or in case instead of if.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives.</li>
          <li>
            I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job.
          </li>
          <li>I'll give you a key in case I'm not at home.</li>
          <li>
            You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight.
          </li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Second conditional</h3>

      <p>
        The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations
        that are impossible or unlikely in reality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If we had a garden, we could have a cat.</li>
          <li>
            If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country.
          </li>
          <li>I wouldn't worry if I were you.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The structure is usually: if + past simple >> + would + infinitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say
        if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also
        common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she
        form.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>If I were you, I wouldn't mention it.</li>
          <li>
            If she was prime minister, she would invest more money in schools.
          </li>
          <li>He would travel more if he was younger.</li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Third Conditional</h2>
      <p>
        we use third conditional to talk about things that did not happen in
        the past and thir imaginary results.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <div class="example">
          <li>
            If I had known you were in hospital, I would have visited you.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would have bought you a present if I had known it was your
            birthday.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you had given me your e-mail, I would have written to you.
          </li>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The structure is usually: if + past perfect, would + have + past
        participle (v3)
      </p>
