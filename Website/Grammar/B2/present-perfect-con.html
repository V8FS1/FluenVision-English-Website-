      <h1 class="page-title title">What's the difference?</h1>

      <h1 class="page-title title">Present Perfect Simple and Present Perfect Continuous</h1>

      <p>We use both of these tenses for finished and unfinished actions.</p>

      <p>The present perfect simple can be used (often with '<strong>since</strong>' and '<strong>for</strong>') to talk
        about unfinished actions that

        started in the past and are still true in the present. It's often used with stative verbs:</p>

      <li><strong>I've known</strong> John <strong>for</strong> three years.</li>

      <p>The present perfect continuous can also be used (often with '<strong>since</strong>' and
        '<strong>for</strong>') to talk about unfinished actions that started in the past and are still true in the
        present.

        (Of course, we don't use the present perfect continuous with stative verbs):</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>She's been living</strong> here <strong>for</strong> three years.</li>

      </div>

      <p>Sometimes there's really no difference in meaning between the two tenses. This is especially the case with
        verbs such as 'live', 'work' and 'study':</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>They've lived</strong> in London <strong>since</strong> 2004.</li>

        <li><strong>They've been living</strong> in London <strong>since</strong> 2004.</li>

        <li><strong>I've studied</strong> French <strong>for</strong> ten years.</li>

        <li><strong>I've been studying</strong> French <strong>for</strong> ten years.</li>

        <li><strong>He's worked </strong> at the company <strong>since</strong> 2009.</li>

        <li><strong>He's been working</strong> at our company <strong>since</strong> 2009.</li>

      </div>

      <p>Sometimes, there is a difference in meaning:</p>

      <p>1: The present perfect continuous can be used to emphasise the length of time that has passed. The present
        perfect simple is generally neutral:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>They've been waiting</strong> <strong>for</strong> hours! (This emphasises the length of time).</li>

        <li><strong>They've waited</strong> <strong>for</strong> hours. (This doesn't emphasise the length of time).
        </li>

      </div>

      <p>2: On the other hand, the present perfect simple is often used when we're talking about how much or how many.
        This isn't possible with the present perfect continuous:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>She's drunk</strong> three cups of coffee this morning.</li>

        <li><strong>She's drunk</strong> at least a litre of coffee today.</li>

        <li><del>(NOT: <strong>she's been drinking</strong> three cups of coffee this morning).</del></li>

      </div>

      <p>3: The present perfect continuous often focuses on the action itself, while the present perfect simple focuses
        on the fact that the action is completed: </p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>I've been reading</strong> the book you recommended. (I'm enjoying it, but I'm not finished).</li>

        <li><strong>I've read</strong> the book you recommended. (I've finished it, so we can talk about it).</li>

      </div>

      <p>We use 'yet' and 'already' with the present perfect simple:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>Have you read</strong> the book yet?</li>

        <li><strong>She's finished</strong> her work already.</li>

      </div>

      <p>This difference is often used to talk about different kinds of results in the present. The present perfect
        simple is used when the action is finished, and the result comes from the action being finished:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>I've eaten</strong> dinner, so let's go out.</li>

        <li><strong>She's done</strong> all her homework, so she can relax this evening.</li>

        <li><strong>I've made</strong> a cake. Would you like some?</li>

      </div>

      <p>The present perfect continuous is used when the result comes from the action itself. It doesn't matter if the
        whole action is finished or not. The result is often something we can see, hear, smell, or feel:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>I've been eating</strong> dinner, so there are plates all over the table.</li>

        <li><strong>She's been doing</strong> her homework, so she's tired.</li>

        <li><strong>I've been making</strong> a cake, that's why the kitchen is such a mess.</li>

      </div>

      <p>4: Finally, the present perfect continuous can be used to emphasise that something is temporary:</p>

      <div class="example">

        <li><strong>She's been running</strong> a lot recently. (She doesn't usually do this).</li>

        <li>Usually I study at home, but <strong>I've been studying</strong> in the library <strong>for</strong> the
          last week.</li>
