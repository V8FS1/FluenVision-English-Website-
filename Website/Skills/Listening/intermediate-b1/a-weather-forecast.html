          <p>

            Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week,

            as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared – just a few patches of

            cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by

            lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can

            expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday.

            <br><br>

            It's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather,

            and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy – and even thundery

            in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle

            and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight.

            <br><br>

            Elsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England,

            tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout

            the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures

            everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees.

            <br><br>

            By the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain.

            The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon.

            Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a

            nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until
            tomorrow.

            Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can!
