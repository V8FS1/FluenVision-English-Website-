          <h2>Transcript</h2>

          <p>

            <strong>Teacher</strong>: So you've got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they
            can both support human life.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah, but do we know that's actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than
            Earth, isn't it? It says here it's about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only places
            like Antarctica get that cold.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance
            from the Sun?

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it's about 228 million
            kilometres, while Earth is about 150 million.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Yes, but in space that's not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million
            kilometres. That's why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1
            astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn't sound so big when you look at it that
            way.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you're right.
            What other similarities are there between the two planets?

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Let's see … not the colour, obviously!

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for
            pretty obvious reasons!

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same
            length. Earth's day is 24 hours but Mars's is about half an hour longer.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: You're right. OK, any other things they both share?

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: I suppose you could say they have water in common.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Could you? How?

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past.
            It's just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Ah, I see. I don't think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth's
            air is nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: Mars doesn't really have air, not compared with Earth. It's got about one per
            cent as much air as Earth.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Right, and it's mostly carbon dioxide.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 2</strong>: Gravity is another difference. I didn't know this, but Mars has higher gravity
            than the Moon. But it's much less than on Earth, of course.

            <br>

            <strong>Student 1</strong>: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth's gravity.

            <br>

            <strong>Teacher</strong>: OK, let's see what you've found …
