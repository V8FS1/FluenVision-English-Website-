          <p>

            Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing

            quick. I have some important information about a change in the

            management team. As you already know, our head of department,

            James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His

            replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the

            meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual. <br />

            <br />

            I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some

            improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few

            weeks. It will be closed during that time. <br />

            <br />

            Don't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church

            car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30

            a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you

            arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park.

            It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the

            evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that â€“ I

            know how much you all love working late! <br />

            <br />

            The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has

            now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash

            for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone

            or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on

            your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each

            month. <br />

            <br />

            OK. That's it? Are there any questions?

          </p>
