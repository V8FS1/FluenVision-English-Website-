            <strong>A</strong>

            <strong>Man</strong>: How did it go? <br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Umm, I think it went quite well. I did a lot of research and prepared a lot. I was
            in there for ... I don't know ... half an hour?<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: And? What did they say?



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Nothing much. At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and
            the<strong>Woman</strong> said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Really?



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Yeah, I think I've got the job. There weren't a lot of other people there. I was the
            only interview that day, you know?<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Well, good luck with it.

            <br>



            <strong>B</strong>

            <strong>Man</strong>: Anyway, you were saying ...



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Oh, yeah, um ... let's see. Yes, so I was in the museum and there were, I don't
            know, a hundred people waiting to get into the room. Finally, I got in, and I tried to see the Mona Lisa but
            I couldn't look at it.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Why not?



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Because the room was filled with people taking photographs of it!<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Oh, right.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Yes! And selfies.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything
            we see when we travel?<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: I know. And we never look at the photos after.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos. I don't feel I'm enjoying things.<br>

            <br>



            <strong>C</strong>

            <strong>Man</strong>: Who took this?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: I can't remember. Hmmm ...<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: What am I doing?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: You're sitting on the sofa, watching TV and eating chocolates. Nothing changes!<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Ha! Very funny. You look very young, though.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: I know. Look at my hair – it was so long!<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Mine too, look at me! Hey … I think I know who took this photo.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Umm … who? Was it Dad?<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: No, it wasn’t Dad or Mum. Do you remember Barry?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: No.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen
            and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry. It's very nice to meet you ...'<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Stop it! He was nice.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Yeah, well, he took the photo.<br>

            <strong>D</strong>

            <strong>Woman</strong>: Let's see. OK. I'm glad we could talk about this. It's not easy to say.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: What?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Well, you're not in our group – for the class project.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: What do you mean? You know I'm always in a group with you.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: I know. It's just that this time … this time we made the group differently and
            because you were late ...<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: I see. You don't want me in the group?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of
            us already.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: So? We can't be a group of five?<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: Well, the teacher said four people per group.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: Oh.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: It's not about you or your work or anything like that. It's ... errrr ... well, we
            already have the group.<br>



            <strong>Man</strong>: So I have to find another group.<br>



            <strong>Woman</strong>: I'm sorry.<br>
