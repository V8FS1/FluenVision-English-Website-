            Hi, it's me. How's it going? I guess you're at work and you don't have your phone on, right?

            First of all, thank you, THANK YOU for the birthday card and message. I received it this morning.

            That's so nice of you. I'm organising a little party for my birthday. It's nothing very big â€“

            only a few of my best and closest friends. That means you too! We're going to have it at my cousin's

            house. She lives in the countryside in a nice big house with a swimming pool. I'd love to see you there.

            It's going to be this Friday. I'll send you the instructions on how to get there later, OK? <br><br>



            Anyway, have fun at work. Don't work too hard, OK? Talk soon. <br>

            Aw, you're still not answering your phone! OK, here are the instructions to get to my cousin's house for

            the party. Are you going to take your car? If you take the car, drive straight on Forest Road until you get

            to the motorway. Drive past Brownsville and take exit 13A. That's 13A. You drive down the road there and
            turn

            left. It's the first big house on the right. OK? If you're taking a bus, you can get the number 80 to
            Brownsville. Call me when you get there and somebody can pick you up in a car. I can't wait. This is going
            to be so great!
