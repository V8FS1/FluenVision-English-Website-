          <p>

            Hello, everyone. Hello! It's nice to see you all here. Welcome to

            British Life and Language. I am your teacher. My name is Lindsay

            Black. That's L-I-N-D-S-A-Y Black. Before we begin, some

            information about the class. <br />

            <br />

            Our class is in room 13, on the first floor. When you go upstairs,

            turn left to find the room. Again, that's room 13. <br />

            <br />

            We have class twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday. Our class

            begins at 4.30 p.m. and lasts 90 minutes, so we finish at 6 p.m.

            That's 4.30 to 6. Please arrive on time, OK?<br />

            <br />

            Also, I have an office hour if you have questions. I'm in office

            7B on the second floor. My office hour is Friday at 6 p.m. So, if

            you have any questions or problems or want to talk to me, it's

            Friday at 6 p.m. in office 7B.<br />

            We begin next week, on March the 13th. That's Monday, March the

            13th. The course ends on May the 20th. May the 20th is the last

            day. <br />

            <br />

            I think that's all ... Oh, one more thing. For this course you

            need the book. Here it is: British Life and Language Level 1

            Student's Book. So, please get a copy of the book. I don't want to

            see any photocopies of the book, thank you! Remember, it's level 1

            student's book. Don't buy the teacher's book. <br />

            <br />

            I think that's all, everyone. I look forward to working with you.

            See you next Monday!
